                NQF 5 Systems Development (WeThinkCode)<br>
                A System Development institution that offers a free course.
                I successfully completed a bootcamp assessment in October 2023 and I was
                accepted to study their 16-month System Development course.
                At WeThinkCode I mastered many skills that are essential to software development
                including excellent team work, collaboration and presentation skills.
